<h3>my neighbour totoro</h3>
<p>
    watched it just recently but left a deep impact on me. a movie which doesnt require spoken words 
    because of the sheer expressiveness of the animation.
</p>
<h3>JFK</h3>
<p>
    unlike the previous one, watched this when i was a kid. very long and in depth. might seem like a drag 
    but worth it. is one of the reasons i grew a fondness for documentary type content.
</p>
<h3>omerta</h3>
<p>
    lastly, a native language movie. made me realise how much effect storytelling and potrayal of opinions, 
    thoughts and ideologies affects any piece of media.
